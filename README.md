# Competition-Logging-system
For this assignment I was asked to combine a number of data structures to create a working system. For this I wanted to create a logging system for a list of competitions, this would take a number of teams and add them to the competition they competed in with the score they achieved. This could be done with any number of competitions and teams. You can then use the system to find what completion you wanted and see which teams placed where. 

To do this I combined two data structures together, binary search trees and linked list. This would allow me to link each competition together through the linked list, and within each link hold a tree. The tree would hold each team that competed in the competition, and sort them based on their score. I believe this was the most effective way of completing this task as the completions would not hold to many teams so would not take long to search through the tree. the tree would also automatically sort the nodes when added to the tree, making the sorting process easier. The linked list is also a good fit for the system as it will give a simple solution for adding and removing competitions where necessary.
